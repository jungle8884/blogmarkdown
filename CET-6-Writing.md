## 主体段 ##

**用两段表示就够了。**

- on one hand, +第一个观点。
	- 或者
- **First and foremost, +第一个观点**：
	- 可以使用的转述句

			Since+原因，we are supposed to do(应该做）

			It is often the case that 用于举例子

- on the other hand, +第二个观点

			再用一两个简单倒装:

## 结尾段 ##

不要再用in conclusion 啦（使用 **in a nutshell** 简单又很高大上，也就是表达了总的说来的含义）

**对结尾，我一般会套用几个模版:**
	
1. it is time for us to do (是我们该做什么的时候啦）
	
2. We need to bear in mind that......（我们应该牢记做什么）
	
3. There is no better way to do than to do (做什么是什么的最好办法）
	
		eg: there is no better way to be independent than【than理解为is】 to earn money on their own.
			(会独立的最好方法就是自己挣钱）

**Respect others, and you will be respected.**
**<敬人者人亦敬之>**

- 第一段:
	- 开门见山，指出**尊重是相互的**，
	- 表明作者的观点：同意“敬人者人亦敬之”的说法。

				- I agree with the saying, respect others and you will be respected.

					- Since Hunmans are grateful animals, we are supposed to help others,
						- and we are very likely to receive assistance when we need it.
					- It is often the case that if we are respectful to others, we will be respected.

	- 第二个观点：**尊重他人被视为一种美德**
	
			- On the other hand, as we all know, 
			- showing respect for others has been regarded as a virtue since ancient times.
			- To be exact, treating people with the dignity they deserve 
				- and allowing them to embrace without judging them 
				- is always considerd as one of great virtues.
			- And in cultures other than the barbarous<野蛮的> one, a virtuous person will definitely gain respect from others.
			- 对应模板的改写：

			- In a nutshell, there is no better way to be respected than to respect others.
