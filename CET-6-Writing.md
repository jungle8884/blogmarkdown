	- 可以使用的转述句

			Since+原因，we are supposed to do(应该做）

## 结尾段 ##

不要再用in conclusion 啦（使用 **in a nutshell** 简单又很高大上，也就是表达了总的说来的含义）

**对结尾，我一般会套用几个模版:**
	
1. it is time for us to do (是我们该做什么的时候啦）
	
2. We need to bear in mind that......（我们应该牢记做什么）
	
3. There is no better way to do than to do (做什么是什么的最好办法）
	
		eg: there is no better way to be independent than【than理解为is】 to earn money on their own.
			(会独立的最好方法就是自己挣钱）
